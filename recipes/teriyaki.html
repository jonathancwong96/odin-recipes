                This is a recipe for a chicken teriyaki.
        </p>

            Ingredients:

        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons sake</li>
            <li>1/4 cup mirin</li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons grated fresh gingerroot</li>
            <li>Splash sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 3/4 pounds chicken thigh fillets</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon peanut oil</li>
            <li>1 3/4 to 2 1/2 cups sushi rice</li>
        </ul>

        Steps:
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the sake, mirin, soy sauce, sugar, ginger and sesame oil in a dish that you can steep the chicken in,
                (I use a 23cm square dish, but anything of similar dimensions would do).
            </li>
            <li>For the sushi roll: On a sushi mat lay down the nori. Spread the sushi rice over the nori in an even layer. 
                Place the salmon horizontally over the bottom third of the sheet, about 1 inch from the edge. 
                Add the prepared chicken pieces and leave for 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat the peanut oil in a large shallow frying pan or casserole (that has a lid) over medium heat.
                Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken pieces from the marinade to the pan. 
                Saute them until they look cooked on the outside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the marinade to the chicken pieces and bring to a bubble, then turn down the heat to a gentle simmer,
                put the lid on and cook for about 5 minutes. Cut into a piece of chicken to make sure it's cooked through.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the cooked pieces with a slotted spoon (you could keep them in a bowl covered in aluminum foil to keep them warm)
                and turn the heat up under the pan to let the liquid boil down to a thick dark syrup.
            </li>
            <li>
                Return the chicken pieces back to the pan, stir well so that all the chicken pieces are coated in the sticky savory syrup.
                Serve with a comforting pile of sushi rice and perhaps some steamed baby bok choy or other veggies of your choice.
            </li>
        </ol>
